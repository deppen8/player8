# Overview
[Arseblog](https://arseblog.com)[1] is an award-winning soccer blog that focuses on [Arsenal Football Club](https://www.arsenal.com/) and has a massive reach. After every Arsenal match, the blog's author posts ratings using the common 0-10 scale [2] for all the Arsenal players who appeared in the match. Beginning in January 2014, Arseblog added the option for readers to submit their own ratings. The averages of these fan ratings are published alongside the author's ratings.
Arseblog has published player ratings like this for over 200 Arsenal matches, so there are more than 3,000 documented player appearances, each with two associated ratings (one from Arseblog, one from the fans). [Read more about the data.](/data.md)

I believe that we can leverage this dataset in a variety of ways. For instance, it could be used to:
- understand how fans view players from their favorite team.
- study how fan perceptions change over time.
- compare fan perceptions of performance vs. other evaluation criteria and advanced metrics.

This project will attempt to explore these ideas and more from both the individual player and team perspective.

## Footnotes 
[1] I am deeply grateful to Andrew Mangan and the rest of the Arseblog.com team for 
[2] See this article from Slate for a quick history of 0-10 player ratings. It also does well to recognize the wild subjectivity of a single person's rankings while still arguing for their utility.
