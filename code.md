Each blog post has an accompanying Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) that steps through the data manipulation and analysis needed for that post.

The code used in the project is available in the [/code](https://github.com/deppen8/player8/tree/gh-pages/code) folder of this repository.

Bits of code that are re-used repeatedly are in the [`arserate.py`](https://github.com/deppen8/player8/blob/gh-pages/code/arserate.py) file.
