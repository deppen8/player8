<p>This project explores fan ratings of players from their (and my) favorite football team, <a href="https://www.arsenal.com" target="_blank">Arsenal Football Club</a>. The data comes from <a href="https://arseblog.com" target="_blank">Arseblog.com</a> <sup>[<a href="#n1">1</a>]</sup>, an award-winning blog that focuses on Arsenal and has a massive reach (<a href="data.md">read about the dataset</a>). Some of the things these fan ratings can be used for include:</p>
<ul>
<li>understanding how fans view individual players.</li>
<li>studying how fan perceptions change over time.</li>
<li>comparing fan perceptions of performance vs. other evaluation criteria and advanced metrics.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>Through the blog entries below, this project examines these ideas and more from both the individual player and team perspectives.</p>
